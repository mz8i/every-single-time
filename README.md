# every-single-time

## What is this?
Solutions to problems I run into every-single-time when I start a project with a certain technology.

## Why?
I tend to forget these tiny bits and end up trawling through Google and StackOverflow every time to put together a running piece of code - and some projects seem to be intent on not providing an actually working example with all the related steps in their documentation (I am looking at you, react-leaflet...)

## (Re)using these notes
Feel free to use these notes as a simple cheatsheet when working with these technologies, but NOTE: this is by no means intended to represent development best practices, but rather it's as a single place to get all the initial problems sorted out and not waste time with every new project.

Your mileage may vary.
